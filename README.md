# My Day 9

Yes, the ninth iteration of my simple sandbox project.

## License

None.  This is a sandbox project.  Just tinkering.

## Getting started

If you want to put this is a docker container:

```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up (or down depending)
```

If you want to run this locally:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

Run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
